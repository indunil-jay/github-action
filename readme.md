### What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a **CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)** platform that allows you to automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your GitHub repository.

### What Does It Do?

GitHub Actions lets you automate tasks like:

-   **Building and testing your code**: Ensures your code works before deploying it.
-   **Deploying applications**: Automatically deploy code to production or staging environments.
-   **Running workflows**: Automate tasks such as linting, code analysis, or sending notifications.
-   **Managing project tasks**: Auto-assign reviewers, create issues, or update project boards.

### What is the Purpose?

The purpose of GitHub Actions is to:

-   **Automate repetitive tasks**: Like testing, building, and deploying.
-   **Improve code quality**: By automatically running tests and linting.
-   **Enhance collaboration**: By integrating workflows with pull requests and issues.
-   **Streamline CI/CD pipelines**: Directly from your GitHub repository.

### When to Use It?

Use GitHub Actions when:

-   You need to **automate CI/CD pipelines** for testing, building, or deploying applications.
-   You want to **automate project management tasks** (e.g., assigning issues or reviewers).
-   You want to **enforce coding standards** by automatically running linters and tests.
-   You require **integration with third-party services** (e.g., Slack notifications, cloud deployments).

### Why Use It?

-   **Easy Integration**: Itâ€™s built into GitHub, so it integrates seamlessly with your repository.
-   **Custom Workflows**: You can create custom workflows for various tasks.
-   **Community Support**: Leverage pre-built actions from the GitHub Marketplace.
